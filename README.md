TellJO - Tech Test

Thank you for the giving me this opportunity to take the test. It was very good and interesting.


1. Bookmark management
	Implement full CRUD management for Bookmarks. Users should be able to create a new category whilst creating a bookmark without requiring any page refresh
	- 


2. User accounts
	The package has the default AspNetCore Identity installed however not implemented fully. Complete this implementation and change the entities to work on a per user basis. For additional credit, implement multiple membership providers allowing users to log in with OpenID services

Now choose one of these:

3. API access
	Expose an API allowing external systems to manage bookmarks. You will need to consider authentication / access tokens
